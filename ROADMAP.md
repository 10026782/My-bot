# BOSS Bot — ROADMAP

עודכן: 01/09/2026

## Latest truth reconciliation — PR1152–1155

Truth Reset: `origin/main` = `b58b27f8771c8ffd4c633a84a28b4009178fbeca` (01/09/2026). PR1153 fixes the Contacts reasoning adapter, retimes `audience_report` to 08:05, and statically wires the three `commercial_crm` create tools. These items are **CLOSED_STATIC / RUNTIME_GATED**; the first-class Deal/Payment TMA surface, owner decision on raw-write ownership, and a real canary remain open. The remaining scheduler collision is Sunday 08:30 (`attribution_report`/`weekly_summary`); the former 08:00 collision is historical/code-done. PR1154 is the authority for the Admin App screen/API gap classification, and PR1155 makes shared-checkout rules canonical in `AGENTS.md`.

The older `SCHEMA_DATA_CONTRACTS` row below predates PR1153's wiring and must be read with this reconciliation as the current status: registration is closed-static; canary, TMA surface, and raw-write ownership remain open.

## תחזוקת המסמך

- `ROADMAP.md` הוא current-state SSOT וניווט, לא implementation ledger.
- `CURRENT STATE` נקבע אך ורק לפי `origin/main` ב־Truth Reset מאומת. ענפים,
  PRs, commits מקומיים וטיוטות מוצגים לכל היותר כ־`PROPOSED / OPEN / NOT YET
  CURRENT` ואינם משנים סטטוס current.
- Program ID הוא זהות יציבה; שם תיאורי או implementation program אינו מחליף אותו.
- Horizon והמסמך הקנוני מחזיקים phase progress; archive מחזיק historical narrative.
- סטטוסי registry מותרים בלבד: `PLANNED`, `IN_PROGRESS`, `MERGED_STATIC`,
  `DEPLOYED`, `RUNTIME_VERIFIED`.
- כל תוכנית פעילה מפנה למקור קנוני מפורט אחד; runtime/deployment דורשים evidence מפורש.
- מסקנת audit/gate לקריאה בלבד שמשנה status, phase, Next, dependency או
  architecture decision חייבת להישמר במסמך current-state קנוני, גם אם לא נוצר PR קוד.
- יחסי תוכניות חייבים להירשם במפורש (`IMPLEMENTATION_OF`, `DEPENDS_ON`,
  `BLOCKED_BY`, `MERGED_INTO`, `CONTINUES`). אין להסיק אותם משמות דומים,
  קבצים משותפים, תחום ארכיטקטוני או כרונולוגיה; ללא marker מפורש היחס הוא `UNKNOWN`.

## 1. Current System Status

המערכת נמצאת ב־`IN_PROGRESS`: תשתיות הליבה, approval/action lifecycle,
Turn Coordinator, מסלולי הכתיבה הקנוניים ו־Command Center קיימים ב־main.
רוב התוכניות דורשות עדיין deployed-SHA או runtime verification; אין להסיק
הפעלה ממסמך תכנון, code default או test מקומי. CORE v1 הוא `MERGED_STATIC /
READY TO FREEZE`; הכרעת freeze ו־formal Layer 2 TurnCoordinator עדיין פתוחות.
מקור הראיות: [`CORE_COMPLETION_AUDIT_20260810.md`](docs/audit/CORE_COMPLETION_AUDIT_20260810.md).

**Truth reconciliation (01/09/2026):** the current execution map findings are
tracked in [`BOSS_CURRENT_STATE.md`](BOSS_CURRENT_STATE.md) and the detailed
evidence remains in [`BUG_AUDIT_LOG.md`](BUG_AUDIT_LOG.md). The active open
sequence is: (1) live Render verification, (2) owner-gated Voice canonical
write canary and legacy retirement, (3) commercial CRM canary/TMA surface and
raw-write ownership decision, and (4) separate owner decisions for missing
TMA capabilities. No
runtime-only item is represented here as static code work.

## 2. Active Programs

| ID | Canonical Name | Status | Evidence | Next | Canonical Source |
|---|---|---|---|---|---|
| TURN_COORDINATOR_PROGRAM | Turn Coordinator | IN_PROGRESS | MERGED_STATIC — TC7-B/RP5 paths recorded | RP5 activation decision and deployed-SHA verification | [`HORIZON.md`](docs/governance/HORIZON.md) |

| N18 | Canonical Write Infrastructure | IN_PROGRESS | MERGED_STATIC — Phase 1 (`create_lead()` service) and Phase 2 (shared primitives) closed 20–21/08/2026; Phase 3 Slice 1 (Telegram Lead Preview cutover, PR #1043 `3de2dcf`) and Phase 4 (Telegram approve/cancel buttons, PR #1065 `2484f3c`) closed and grep/test-verified on `origin/main` (30/08/2026 documentation-gate pass) — `test_n18_slice1_lead_preview.py` 6/6, `test_n18_phase4_telegram_buttons.py` 4/4, `test_n18_draft_dispatch_unification.py` 8/8. WhatsApp (`lead_capture.py` / `core/whatsapp_lead_cutover.py`), Email (`inbound_handler.py` / `core/noninteractive_lead_cutovers.py`) and Furniture (`furniture_lead_funnel.py` via the same module) already call `create_lead()` in code today. Owner Resolution for non-interactive sources is already implemented (`core/source_owner_mapping.py`'s `resolve_owner_user_id()`/`resolve_furniture_owner_user_id()`, consumed by all three `noninteractive_lead_cutovers.py` wrappers) — not an open prerequisite. `LeadMemory` is a post-write enrichment/update path (`core.lead_service.update_lead_fields()`) and never creates a Lead, so it is not a creation-writer gap. | Voice IVR (`voice_adapter.py`) is the only writer with a live legacy `airtable_add()` bypass when `VOICE_CANONICAL_LEAD_WRITE` is off (its canonical path, `create_voice_inbound_lead()`, already exists and already resolves Owner). Remaining work is the owner-gated `WHATSAPP_CANONICAL_LEAD_WRITE`/`VOICE_CANONICAL_LEAD_WRITE` activation + live canary, then retiring Voice's legacy branch. Additional entity consumers (Tasks/Payments/Deals/Contacts/Expenses) require a separate owner-approved slice. | [`N18_PHASE_3_CANONICAL_LEAD_WRITERS_SPEC.md`](docs/architecture/n18-canonical-lead-writers/N18_PHASE_3_CANONICAL_LEAD_WRITERS_SPEC.md) |

The historical dependency Pending Approval stable → U1 decision → UX-01 is
satisfied. U1 is resolved at architecture/static level. F52 / Single-Speaker
Approval UX is the implementation program/slice of UX-01; it does not rename
or replace the UX-01 identity. U1 is an architecture decision/gate resolved at
static level and is not an active blocker. F52 is explicitly
`IMPLEMENTATION_OF: UX-01`; no other parent/child or dependency relation is
assumed without an explicit marker.

## 3. Open Architecture / Owner Decisions

### RP5 Production Activation

Status: PLANNED / ACTIVATION DEFERRED. Owner decision: continue shadow evidence
collection and keep `FEATURE_EVIDENCE_FINALIZER=enforce` OFF. Reconsider activation
only after production shadow evidence review, deployed-SHA/canary conditions,
rollback readiness, and separate owner approval. This is an activation decision,
not permission to change the implementation. Canonical source:
[`RP5_PREFLIGHT_BLOCKER.md`](RP5_PREFLIGHT_BLOCKER.md).

## 4. Deferred / Blocked

### Queue / Worker Architecture

Status: PLANNED. Deferred until an explicit product/scheduler requirement and
ownership decision exists. Canonical source: [`HORIZON.md`](docs/governance/HORIZON.md).

### Generic Draft Capability

Status: PLANNED. Deferred until the business requirement and scope are confirmed.
Canonical source: [`HORIZON.md`](docs/governance/HORIZON.md).
