# BOSS Bot — ROADMAP

עודכן: 30/08/2026

## תחזוקת המסמך

- `ROADMAP.md` הוא current-state SSOT וניווט, לא implementation ledger.
- `CURRENT STATE` נקבע אך ורק לפי `origin/main` ב־Truth Reset מאומת. ענפים,
  PRs, commits מקומיים וטיוטות מוצגים לכל היותר כ־`PROPOSED / OPEN / NOT YET
  CURRENT` ואינם משנים סטטוס current.
- Program ID הוא זהות יציבה; שם תיאורי או implementation program אינו מחליף אותו.
- Horizon והמסמך הקנוני מחזיקים phase progress; archive מחזיק historical narrative.
- סטטוסי registry מותרים בלבד: `PLANNED`, `IN_PROGRESS`, `MERGED_STATIC`,
  `DEPLOYED`, `RUNTIME_VERIFIED`.
- כל תוכנית פעילה מפנה למקור קנוני מפורט אחד; runtime/deployment דורשים evidence מפורש.
- מסקנת audit/gate לקריאה בלבד שמשנה status, phase, Next, dependency או
  architecture decision חייבת להישמר במסמך current-state קנוני, גם אם לא נוצר PR קוד.
- יחסי תוכניות חייבים להירשם במפורש (`IMPLEMENTATION_OF`, `DEPENDS_ON`,
  `BLOCKED_BY`, `MERGED_INTO`, `CONTINUES`). אין להסיק אותם משמות דומים,
  קבצים משותפים, תחום ארכיטקטוני או כרונולוגיה; ללא marker מפורש היחס הוא `UNKNOWN`.

## 1. Current System Status

המערכת נמצאת ב־`IN_PROGRESS`: תשתיות הליבה, approval/action lifecycle,
Turn Coordinator, מסלולי הכתיבה הקנוניים ו־Command Center קיימים ב־main.
רוב התוכניות דורשות עדיין deployed-SHA או runtime verification; אין להסיק
הפעלה ממסמך תכנון, code default או test מקומי. CORE v1 הוא `MERGED_STATIC /
READY TO FREEZE`; הכרעת freeze ו־formal Layer 2 TurnCoordinator עדיין פתוחות.
מקור הראיות: [`CORE_COMPLETION_AUDIT_20260810.md`](docs/audit/CORE_COMPLETION_AUDIT_20260810.md).

## 2. Active Programs

| ID | Canonical Name | Status | Evidence | Next | Canonical Source |
|---|---|---|---|---|---|
| TURN_COORDINATOR_PROGRAM | Turn Coordinator | IN_PROGRESS | MERGED_STATIC — TC7-B/RP5 paths recorded | RP5 activation decision and deployed-SHA verification | [`HORIZON.md`](docs/governance/HORIZON.md) |
| UNIFIED_APPROVAL_ACTIONGATEWAY | Unified Approval / ActionGateway | IN_PROGRESS | MERGED_STATIC — lifecycle and approval paths | Runtime verification of approved paths | [`HORIZON.md`](docs/governance/HORIZON.md) |
| F52 | F52 Unified Approval Runtime — Unified User Messages | IN_PROGRESS | R4, R4.1 and R6.1–R6.6 MERGED / STATIC VERIFIED; R5 GATE_COMPLETE; R7.1–R7.2 MERGED / STATIC VERIFIED (`3c45a87`, `1ff1cee`) | Continue with the next gated WhatsApp adapter sequence or separately gated runtime/deployment work | [`SINGLE_SPEAKER_APPROVAL_UX_UNIFIED_TELEGRAM_WHATSAPP_PLAN.md`](docs/architecture/f52-unified-approval-runtime/rollout/SINGLE_SPEAKER_APPROVAL_UX_UNIFIED_TELEGRAM_WHATSAPP_PLAN.md) |
| N18 | Canonical Write Infrastructure | IN_PROGRESS | MERGED_STATIC — Phase 1 (`create_lead()` service) and Phase 2 (shared primitives) closed 20–21/08/2026; Phase 3 Slice 1 (Telegram Lead Preview cutover, PR #1043 `3de2dcf`) and Phase 4 (Telegram approve/cancel buttons, PR #1065 `2484f3c`) closed and grep/test-verified on `origin/main` (30/08/2026 documentation-gate pass) — `test_n18_slice1_lead_preview.py` 6/6, `test_n18_phase4_telegram_buttons.py` 4/4, `test_n18_draft_dispatch_unification.py` 8/8. WhatsApp (`lead_capture.py` / `core/whatsapp_lead_cutover.py`), Email (`inbound_handler.py` / `core/noninteractive_lead_cutovers.py`) and Furniture (`furniture_lead_funnel.py` via the same module) already call `create_lead()` in code today. Owner Resolution for non-interactive sources is already implemented (`core/source_owner_mapping.py`'s `resolve_owner_user_id()`/`resolve_furniture_owner_user_id()`, consumed by all three `noninteractive_lead_cutovers.py` wrappers) — not an open prerequisite. `LeadMemory` is a post-write enrichment/update path (`core.lead_service.update_lead_fields()`) and never creates a Lead, so it is not a creation-writer gap. | Voice IVR (`voice_adapter.py`) is the only writer with a live legacy `airtable_add()` bypass when `VOICE_CANONICAL_LEAD_WRITE` is off (its canonical path, `create_voice_inbound_lead()`, already exists and already resolves Owner). Remaining work is the owner-gated `WHATSAPP_CANONICAL_LEAD_WRITE`/`VOICE_CANONICAL_LEAD_WRITE` activation + live canary, then retiring Voice's legacy branch. Additional entity consumers (Tasks/Payments/Deals/Contacts/Expenses) require a separate owner-approved slice. | [`N18_PHASE_3_CANONICAL_LEAD_WRITERS_SPEC.md`](docs/architecture/n18-canonical-lead-writers/N18_PHASE_3_CANONICAL_LEAD_WRITERS_SPEC.md) |
| LEAD_CRM_CANONICAL_FLOW | Lead / CRM canonical flow | IN_PROGRESS | MERGED_STATIC — canary pending | Draft → Approval → Write → Evidence canary | [`HORIZON.md`](docs/governance/HORIZON.md) |
| MEDIA_LAYER_F16 | Media Layer (F16) | IN_PROGRESS | IN_PROGRESS — CORE REMEDIATION COMPLETE (STATIC VERIFIED IN PR / MERGE PENDING) / LOW-RISK CLEANUP REMAINS / RUNTIME NOT ESTABLISHED — M1/M4 statically verified fixed and merged (Slice 1); M2 (MIME allowlist, fail-closed) and M3 (durable failure trace without a reservation id) implemented and statically verified in an open PR, not yet merged; low-risk cleanup findings remain open; full record in `BUG_AUDIT_LOG.md` | Merge the open Slice 2 PR, then low-risk cleanup — only then the gated deployed-SHA canary | [`HORIZON.md`](docs/governance/HORIZON.md) |
| COMMAND_CENTER_KNOWLEDGE_HUB | Command Center / Knowledge Hub | IN_PROGRESS | MERGED_STATIC — endpoint verification pending | Verify endpoint | [`HORIZON.md`](docs/governance/HORIZON.md) |
| BOSS_MEMORY_RETRIEVAL | BOSS Memory & Retrieval Architecture | IN_PROGRESS | MERGED_STATIC — retrieval shadow-only | Accumulate shadow evidence before cutover | [`BOSS_MEMORY_RETRIEVAL_ARCHITECTURE_2026-08.md`](docs/research/BOSS_MEMORY_RETRIEVAL_ARCHITECTURE_2026-08.md) |
| DECISION_HUB | Decision Hub | IN_PROGRESS | PROGRAM STATUS DRIFT FOUND — CALLBACK / RECORD-SCOPE REMEDIATION REQUIRED — RUNTIME NOT ESTABLISHED. DH-S1 formula safety CLOSED / STATIC VERIFIED; DH-S2 access-policy wording DOC/POLICY DRIFT / REMEDIATION REQUIRED; DH-S3 fail-closed reads STATIC VERIFIED; DH-S4 partial write observability OPEN; DH-CB-01–DH-CB-09 callback/record-scope findings recorded. Protected CLI paths remain positive evidence; the full authorization layer is not claimed broken. | Bounded callback/record-scope remediation: propagate identity/tenant/domain context, scope enumeration and matching, validate Inbox↔Decision links, add callback fail-closed coverage; then remediate partial-persistence observability | [`HORIZON.md`](docs/governance/HORIZON.md) |
| COST_AGENT_LAST | Cost / Agent-Last architecture | IN_PROGRESS | MERGED_STATIC — telemetry remains shadow | Validate live usage/cost and decide progression | [`BOSS_UNIFIED_MASTER_PLAN.md`](docs/governance/BOSS_UNIFIED_MASTER_PLAN.md) |
| ARCHITECTURE_AUTHORITY_BOUNDARIES | Architecture authority / execution boundaries | IN_PROGRESS | MERGED_STATIC — runtime evidence separate | Verify deployed-SHA authority | [`BOSS_UNIFIED_MASTER_PLAN.md`](docs/governance/BOSS_UNIFIED_MASTER_PLAN.md) |
| SCHEMA_DATA_CONTRACTS | Schema / Data Contracts | IN_PROGRESS | MERGED_STATIC + LIVE SCHEMA VERIFIED — corrected a stale Leads tier-field comment in tma_api.py against live Airtable schema (30/08/2026); added the Payment Terms table plus Deals/Payments schema fields in live Airtable and the corresponding airtable_schema.py constants, with commercial_crm.py (create_deal/create_payment/create_payment_term writers + calculate_payment() calculation contract, 54/54 tests) as a not-yet-wired foundation slice (30/08/2026). Track 8 static reconciliation complete (30/08/2026, see `MAINTENANCE_AUDIT_LEDGER.md` §"Track 8"): no owned MEDIUM/HIGH static gap remains; commercial_crm.py's writer field-name + linked-record contract statically verified against schema_cache.json, now machine-checked (97/97 tests, +43 snapshot-fidelity checks). **Track 8B live verification complete (30/08/2026, see `MAINTENANCE_AUDIT_LEDGER.md` §"Track 8B" and `docs/governance/TRACK_8B_LIVE_SCHEMA_RECONCILIATION_30082026.md`)**: read-only Airtable MCP pass against the live base (`app4bcgoX7t0HUVnm`) confirmed all 31 `TABLE_CLASS_MAP` tables exist live and reconciled field-by-field; F7's 14 uncached tables (Sessions, ActionContracts, Business Memory, Profile, Ventures, Expenses, Decision Events, Decisions, Decision Inbox, Decision Stakeholders, Marketing Demand, Marketing Publications, Emergency Stop Flags, External Execution Jobs) all confirmed to exist live with real field data — F7 fully resolved, no live gap; `Tables.LEAD_EVENTS` confirmed to exist live (8/8 exact field match); the full Deal/Payment/Payment-Term enum contract (DealStage, PaymentStatus, VATRule, PaymentTermCalcType/Basis/Trigger/Cadence) live-verified against `get_table_schema`, all exact matches except one new finding (`PaymentStatus.CANCELLED` = "cancelled" vs live "canceled" — latent, unreachable by any writer). `schema_cache.json` itself was left unregenerated (read-only mandate) but confirmed safe to regenerate. **Track 8C cache + code cleanup complete (30/08/2026, see `MAINTENANCE_AUDIT_LEDGER.md` §"Track 8C")**: `schema_cache.json` regenerated from a fresh read-only `list_tables_for_base` pull (45 live tables; the stale `תשלומים (Payments)` entry is gone); all 4 LOW-risk findings Track 8B deferred are now fixed — `PaymentFields.CONTACT` deleted (+ `crm_add_payment()`'s dead contact-handling code path removed), `ContactFields.TYPE` deleted, `tools/airtable_tools.py`'s dead `_sanitize_fields()`/`_TABLE_FIELDS` Payments mapping removed entirely (zero callers), `PaymentStatus.CANCELLED` corrected to `"canceled"` (plus a second live-relevant `"cancelled"` literal found and fixed in `tma_api.py`'s `finance_pulse` exclude-filter). All known code/cache gaps from Track 8/8B are now closed; `schema_audit.py --offline` + the full affected test surface pass. One judgment call left as-is (not a gap, a deliberate boundary): `tools/dispatcher.py`'s local `_ALIAS_MAP` still keeps its 4 still-live Hebrew-table aliases (Tasks/Contacts/Deals/Expenses) — only the stale Payments→Hebrew-name entry was removed | Register the 3 new Deal/Payment tools in tool_registry.py/tools/dispatcher.py/tools/schemas.py (still open, out of Track 8C's declared scope); K10's Owner/owner field-name-casing fragmentation (naming-only, zero relationship risk per Track 8B) remains open, untouched by Track 8C | [`MAINTENANCE_AUDIT_LEDGER.md`](docs/governance/MAINTENANCE_AUDIT_LEDGER.md) |

The historical dependency Pending Approval stable → U1 decision → UX-01 is
satisfied. U1 is resolved at architecture/static level. F52 / Single-Speaker
Approval UX is the implementation program/slice of UX-01; it does not rename
or replace the UX-01 identity. U1 is an architecture decision/gate resolved at
static level and is not an active blocker. F52 is explicitly
`IMPLEMENTATION_OF: UX-01`; no other parent/child or dependency relation is
assumed without an explicit marker.

## 3. Open Architecture / Owner Decisions

### RP5 Production Activation

Status: PLANNED / ACTIVATION DEFERRED. Owner decision: continue shadow evidence
collection and keep `FEATURE_EVIDENCE_FINALIZER=enforce` OFF. Reconsider activation
only after production shadow evidence review, deployed-SHA/canary conditions,
rollback readiness, and separate owner approval. This is an activation decision,
not permission to change the implementation. Canonical source:
[`RP5_PREFLIGHT_BLOCKER.md`](RP5_PREFLIGHT_BLOCKER.md).

## 4. Deferred / Blocked

### Queue / Worker Architecture

Status: PLANNED. Deferred until an explicit product/scheduler requirement and
ownership decision exists. Canonical source: [`HORIZON.md`](docs/governance/HORIZON.md).

### Generic Draft Capability

Status: PLANNED. Deferred until the business requirement and scope are confirmed.
Canonical source: [`HORIZON.md`](docs/governance/HORIZON.md).
