# TurnCoordinator + TurnEnvelope

## Purpose

Architectural proposal for a `TurnCoordinator` that owns per-turn context
(`TurnEnvelope`) and reply ownership, so the agent is always aware of pending
state and capability boundaries from one unified source instead of drifting
mechanisms.

## Relationship to F52

This does not replace F52 (`../f52-unified-approval-runtime/`). F52's audit
maps (tool map, approval flow map, state flow map, bypass map, contract
coverage map) are the input this proposal's Phase 0 consumes and extends —
not re-derives. Phase 0 adds turn-ownership dimensions on top of the existing
F52/Phase 4C audits (reply ownership, pending queue source, outbound sender,
agent dependency, deterministic availability, message kind) rather than
starting a new full-system audit.

## Documents

- `TURN_COORDINATOR_PROPOSAL_V2.md` — the current proposal (v2). Status:
  architectural proposal, ready for Phase 0 implementation planning, not yet
  ready for implementation until Phase 0 turns it into an exact list of call
  sites and state sources.

## Status

Planning — Phase 0 not started.
